# Flash Card English-French
A Flash Card game made in Python which contains 100 words in french for you to practice your french! <br>

## How does the game work?
It'll show up a card with a **french word**, after 2 seconds, the card flips and it'll show an **english word**. If the english word matches with the french one, then you must press the **✅ BUTTON**.<br> 
If doesn't, you must press the **❌ BUTTON**.

## Libs/Modules
For this project, I used:
- Pandas
- Tkinter
- Random

### Obs:
If you don't have Pandas Module, you must install it before run the code. Copy and Paste "__pip install pandas__" in Python Terminal.

Feel free to fork/clone the entire code and to change it by yourself the way you want ;)
